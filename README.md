# flutter_notes

I have started organizing this project and I am learning the process of app development with Flutter. In this project, I aim to create mobile apps using Dart and Flutter technologies. My goal is to make a useful and beautiful mobile app and to better understand the Flutter ecosystem

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
